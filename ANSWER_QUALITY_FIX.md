# âœ… Answer Quality Fix

## Problem
The AI was generating repetitive, meaningless responses like:
```
"Describe the common human rights. Describe the common human rights. Describe the common human rights..."
```

## Root Cause
The `google/flan-t5-small` model was getting stuck in repetition loops due to:
1. **Too long prompts** - Causing confusion
2. **Insufficient repetition penalty** - Allowing loops
3. **No post-processing** - Repetitive content not cleaned

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Improved Generation Parameters âœ…
```python
# Before
max_length=512
repetition_penalty=1.2

# After
max_length=256  # Shorter to prevent loops
repetition_penalty=2.0  # Much stronger
no_repeat_ngram_size=3  # Prevent 3-word repetition
```

### 2. Simplified Prompt âœ…
**Before**: Long, complex prompt with 9 instructions
**After**: Short, clear prompt asking for 3-4 sentences

### 3. Added Content Cleaning âœ…
- New function `_clean_repetitive_content()` to remove duplicates
- Detects and removes exact duplicate sentences
- Limits output to 5 unique sentences maximum

### 4. Fallback Mechanism âœ…
If the model generates poor output:
- Checks if answer is too short (< 30 chars)
- Checks if answer has enough sentences (< 2 sentences)
- Provides informative fallback message

## Expected Results

### Before:
```
"Describe the common human rights. Describe the common human rights. Describe..."
```

### After:
```
"Common human rights include the right to life, liberty, and security. Workers have rights 
to fair wages, safe working conditions, and freedom from discrimination. Consumers have 
rights to information, choice, and redressal under consumer protection laws..."
```

## How It Works Now

1. **Retrieval**: Gets relevant document chunks
2. **Generation**: Uses optimized parameters to prevent loops
3. **Cleaning**: Removes repetitive content
4. **Validation**: Checks quality, provides fallback if needed
5. **Output**: Clean, readable answer

## Technical Details

### Generation Parameters:
- `max_length=256` - Shorter outputs
- `min_length=50` - Minimum quality threshold
- `num_beams=3` - Beam search width
- `temperature=0.9` - More variation
- `repetition_penalty=2.0` - Strong anti-repetition
- `length_penalty=0.8` - Shorter answers
- `no_repeat_ngram_size=3` - Prevent 3-word loops

### Content Cleaning:
- Removes exact duplicate sentences
- Limits to 5 unique sentences
- Preserves meaningful content

## Testing

Restart the application:
```bash
streamlit run app_unified.py
```

Try these questions:
1. "What are the common human rights?"
2. "What are worker rights?"
3. "How can I file a consumer complaint?"

You should now get meaningful, non-repetitive answers!
