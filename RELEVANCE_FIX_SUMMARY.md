# ‚úÖ Answer Relevance Fix

## Problem
Answers were not relevant to user queries - AI would retrieve documents but generate generic or off-topic responses.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Poor Retrieval Filtering** - Not checking if documents actually contain relevant keywords
2. **Weak Prompting** - LLM not forced to stay on-topic
3. **No Relevance Validation** - No check if answer actually addresses the question
4. **Insufficient Context** - Only using 200 chars instead of more context

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Improved Document Retrieval ‚úÖ

**Before**: Simple vector search, no filtering
```python
results = self.collection.query(query_embeddings=[...], n_results=top_k)
```

**After**: Keyword-based filtering for relevance
```python
# Get more candidates
results = self.collection.query(query_embeddings=[...], n_results=min(top_k * 2, 10))

# Filter by keyword relevance
for doc in retrieved_docs:
    keywords_found = sum(1 for word in query_keywords if word in doc['text'].lower())
    if keywords_found > 0:
        relevant_docs.append(doc)
```

**Benefit**: Only documents with actual query keywords are used

### 2. Query Expansion ‚úÖ

New function: `_expand_query()`
- Adds synonyms to improve retrieval
- Example: "worker" ‚Üí also searches for "employee", "labor"
- Example: "rights" ‚Üí also searches for "protection", "entitlements"

**Benefit**: Finds documents even with different terminology

### 3. Better Context Formatting ‚úÖ

**Before**: Short snippets (200 chars)
```python
snippet = doc['text'][:200]
```

**After**: Longer, better formatted context (400 chars)
```python
text_snippet = doc['text'][:400]
context = f"Document 1 from {source} (Page {page}):\n{text_snippet}"
```

**Benefit**: LLM gets more complete information

### 4. Improved Prompting ‚úÖ

**Before**: Generic prompt
```python
prompt = f"Answer: {query}"
```

**After**: Structured prompt with constraints
```python
prompt = f"""Based only on the information provided below, answer: "{query}"

Relevant Information:
{context}

Important Instructions:
- Answer ONLY using the information provided above
- If information doesn't address the question, say "Based on available documents..."
- Be specific and cite document source
- Write in simple, clear language
- Keep focused on what documents actually say

Answer:"""
```

**Benefit**: Forces LLM to stay on-topic and use only provided context

### 5. Relevance Validation ‚úÖ

New function: `_is_answer_relevant()`
- Checks if answer contains question keywords
- Requires 30% keyword match
- Adds context if answer seems generic

**Benefit**: Detects and handles off-topic answers

### 6. Fallback Messages ‚úÖ

**Before**: Generic error message

**After**: Helpful, specific fallback
```python
if not retrieved_docs:
    return {
        'answer': f"I couldn't find specific information about '{question}'... 
                   The documents cover: worker rights, consumer protection, 
                   digital privacy..."
    }
```

**Benefit**: Users know why and what to ask instead

## Expected Results

### Before:
**Query**: "What are the common human rights?"
**Answer**: "Describe the common human rights. Describe the common human rights..." (repetitive)
**Relevance**: ‚ùå Not relevant

### After:
**Query**: "What are the common human rights?"
**Answer**: "Based on the available documents, common human rights include the right to life, liberty, and security. Workers have rights to fair wages and safe working conditions. Consumers have rights to information, choice, and redressal. (Cited from India Handbook of Labour, Page 50)"
**Relevance**: ‚úÖ Highly relevant

## Technical Improvements

| Feature | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Context Length | 200 chars | 400 chars |
| Retrieval Filtering | None | Keyword-based |
| Query Expansion | No | Yes |
| Relevance Check | No | Yes |
| Prompt Structure | Simple | Detailed with constraints |
| Fallback | Generic error | Helpful guidance |

## How It Works Now

1. **Query Expansion** ‚Üí Adds synonyms (worker ‚Üí employee, labor)
2. **Retrieval** ‚Üí Gets more candidates (2x top_k)
3. **Filtering** ‚Üí Keeps only docs with query keywords
4. **Formatting** ‚Üí Better context structure (400 chars, labeled)
5. **Prompting** ‚Üí Forces on-topic with constraints
6. **Validation** ‚Üí Checks relevance, adds context if needed
7. **Output** ‚Üí Relevant, cited answer

## Testing

Restart and test:
```bash
streamlit run app_unified.py
```

Try these queries:
1. "What are worker rights?" ‚Üí Should cite labor documents
2. "How to file consumer complaint?" ‚Üí Should cite consumer handbook
3. "What is minimum wage?" ‚Üí Should cite relevant labor laws
4. "Digital privacy rights?" ‚Üí Should cite privacy regulations

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ Answers directly address the question
‚úÖ Answers cite specific document sources
‚úÖ Answers use only information from documents
‚úÖ Answers are specific, not generic
‚úÖ Answers provide helpful guidance
